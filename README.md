# Kaggle-Problem-Starship-Titanic
It contains the solution for the Kaggle Starship Titanic Problem.  
It is a Supervised Classification Problem.
We are provided with a train data and test data. 
The training dataset contains 14 columns and 8693 rows.
The columns are PassengerId,HomePlanet,CryoSleep,Cabin,Destination,Age,VIP,RoomService,FoodCourt,ShoppingMall,Spa,VRDeck,Name,Transported

The testing dataset contains 13 columns and 4277 rows.

I have used here two classification algorithm 
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Method
2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Method

Results:
From the results we can see we got better accuracy in SVM than ANN, while ANN gave us a better Precision.
